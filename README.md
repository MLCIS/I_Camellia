   here is a snipt for a statistic report , i use 4 diff in ,then got it , every out is 2048 unsigned char,then i show the statistic result for every 0\~255 .
   ![statistic report ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MLCIS/I_Camellia/master/figure_1.png)

   the most ideally case is every u_char 's time is 8.0 (2048/256),now the reality is 7.8\~8.3 (average) .. so it is like a good algorithm . 

   follow is main Structure ..
